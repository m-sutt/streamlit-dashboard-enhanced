# Enhanced Streamlit Dashboard School Learning Modalities (2020-2021)
## Overview

### This Streamlit dashboard visualizes school learning modalities during the 2020 - 2021 academic year. Using publicly available data  from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The learning modalities are as follow:
- Hybrid
- In-person
- Remote

### ***Purpose***: This will highlight trends and patterns for learning during the pandemic school year (2020 - 2021). This project demonstrates my ability to build, enhance, and deploy an interactive and visually appealing Streamlit dashboard. The enhancements include:
- Additional visualizations
- Interactive components
- Explanatory text and improved layout

### The inital codes were forked from user: @hantswilliams

###  This is the link for the new streamlit: [New Dashboard](https://effective-succotash-7vv9xrgv6ww92g9v-8501.app.github.dev/)

## New Visulization and Features:
- Added a line chart showing trends in learning modalities over time. This was succesful.
- Added pie chart depicting the proportion of students in each learning modalities. This could be better.
- Heatmap of student counts across weeks. This could be a lot better.

# Reflection

- This was a project that brought many of my knowledge into a nice visualization.
- Relatively very easy to use with GItHub codespaces compare to my own local machine.
- I wanted more experiencce creating a heatmap and interactive dashboard. I was able to get the code for the heatmap up and running but it could be refined a bit more with better and easier to understand.
- Not personally a big fan of pie charts, but it's there. Can be better through a legend or better tags.
